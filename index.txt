== Introduction

Among the various techniques currently used in local helioseismology 
(Ring- diagram analysis: Hill (1988); Time-distance analysis: Duvall et al. (1993); Acoustic holography: Lindsey & Braun (1998)), 
the Fourier-Hankel spectral decomposition was one of the earliest techniques used 
by helioseismologists to explore the subsurface regions of the Sun. It was first 
employed by Braun et al. (1987), and later followed up by a series of work 
(Braun et al., 1988; Braun & Duvall, 1990; Braun et al., 1990, 1992) to study the 
interaction of solar acoustic modes (p-modes) with isolated large scale magnetic 
structures like sunspots. Sunspots are local discontinuities in the near surface 
regions of the Sun. The p-modes sample these discontinuities and leave signature 
of their interaction on the oscillation spectra. 
Whereas, the spectra of the modes that have not encountered the sunspot remains 
unaltered. Fourier- Hankel method can be used to separate these two wave fields. 
This is done by decomposing the wave field into radially inward and outward 
propagating waves on an annular region centered in the sunspot. 
Although, Hankel 
functions are good approximations, later studies also explored this method with 
the help of associated Legendre functions to account for the curvature of the 
solar surface. 

The application of Fourier-Hankel/Legendre technique was later 
extended to other helioseismic studies. Braun & Fan (1998) carried out meridional 
flow measurements using this technique by decomposing the wavefield into equatorward 
and poleward wavefields and measuring the frequency shifts between them.
Further work carried out by Krieger et al. (2007) and Doerr et al. (2010) in this 
direction have resulted in the development of a fast and efficient code for the 
computation of Fourier-Hankel/Legendre transform which can be easily applied to a 
large amount of data (Glogowski, 2011). Preliminary results for meridional flow 
obtained from this work are comparable to the results obtained using ring- diagram 
analysis.

This document provides a description of the
Fourier-Hankel/Legendre module on the SDO/HMI JSOC data-analysis pipeline for 
processing HMI data. 

== Installing

Extract the archive to the local directory. 
Edit the Makefile with the appropriate paths to CFITSIO, HDF5 (requires hdf5-1.8.14 compiled with the *--enable-parallel* option), PostgreSQL, and DRMS libraries.

[source,shell]
----
./configure
make
----

In case the libraries are not located in your default path.
Configure it with the respective paths.

[source,shell]
----
./configure --with-hdf5=<Path to the h5pcc executable> --with-cfitsio=<CFITSIO path> --with-drms=<DRMS Path>
make
----


Make produces three executables: postel_remap, tld, fld.


== Workflow

The Fourier-Legendre analysis are usually performed on small areas of the solar 
surface to infer the average properties beneath the selected region. For instance, 
to estimate the meridional flow as a function of latitude, rectangular patches 
are extracted from the Dopplergrams in the North-South direction along a 
specific longitude (usually the Stonyhurst φ = 0◦), centered at different 
latitudes. The Fourier-Hankel/Legendre decomposition gives the amplitude of the 
poleward and equatorward directed flow field. The difference in frequency between 
these two oppositely directed components can be attributed to a Doppler shift 
as a result of a flow in a particular direction. Assuming that the origin of this 
flow is be due to the meridional circulation, the frequency shifts can be inverted 
to get the magnitude of the meridional flow at different depths as a function of 
latitudes. For sunspot seismology, annular regions are selected centered in the 
spot and the decomposition gives the amplitude of the ingoing and outgoing waves 
within this annulus. The absorption coefficients and scattering phase-shifts can 
then be estimated from the amplitude of the two components. It should be noted that, 
for the meridional flow measurements the center is fixed on one of the poles, 
while in the case of sunspot it is the spot center. In both cases, the decomposition 
is carried out on a equi-angluar grid and therefore the first step is to select 
the region of interest and map it onto an appropriate grid. The Fourier-Hankel/Legendre 
decomposition is then carried on this tracked/mapped cube.

=== 1. Mapping and Tracking - `mtrack`

Each data set (e.g. Dopplergrams, Tracked cubes, SHT coefficients, etc.) is identified by a series in the DRMS (Data Record Management System).

==== Create a new data series

We start by creating a new data series in the DRMS that can hold the tracked cubes: latexmath:[V_z (\Theta,\Phi,t)]. 
The data series is created using a series definition file, or a JSD file.
A template is available under *kis_vigeesh.hmi_fldvtrack.jsd*. +

To create a series that will hold the cube generated using mtrack:

[source,shell]
----
create_series kis_vigeesh.hmi_fldvtrack.jsd
----

.Note:
Unlike the usual pipeline data series, this definiton file does not specify the final pixel size and the time-length of the tracked data. This is set to be a variable.


==== Track the region

The next step is to track the desired region. The primary input to the module *mtrack* are the full-disk Dopplergrams available as the data series *hmi.v_45s*. 
We need to pass the *lat* and *lon* arguments to specify the Heliographic Latitude (latexmath:[\Theta]) and Longitude(latexmath:[\Phi]) of the center of the region to be tracked. The *scale* argument sets the desired MapScale in degrees/pixel.
The *rows* and *cols* are the total number of pixel-rows and columns of the final mapped region.
The FLD part can only process _PlateCarree_ map projection currently, and so the *map* argument has to be set to '_carree_'. 
The tracked output will be stored in the data series that we just defined.

.Example
To generate an untracked region (flag: *-n*) centered at latexmath:[(\Theta,\Phi)=(0,200)] sapnning 8 hours, with the line-of-sight component of observer velocity (flag: *-o*) and solar rotation (flag: *-r*) removed,

[source,shell]
----
./mtrack in='hmi.v_45s[2010.06.01_00:00:00_TAI/8h]' out='kis_vigeesh.hmi_fldvtrack' \
scale=0.125 lat="{0.}" lon="{200.}" map="carree" rows=400 cols=400 -n -v -o -r
----

There are several ways one can call *mtrack*. +
To generate multiple sets of tracked regions, one can specify the *lat* and and *lon* as: + 
`lat="{0.,10.,-10.}" lon="{200.}"` - maps centered at latexmath:[(\Theta,\Phi) = (-10.,200.) , (0.,200.), (+10.,200.)]. +
`lat="{0.,10.,-10.}" lon="{200.,210.,195.}"` - maps centered at latexmath:[(\Theta,\Phi) = (0.,200.) , (10.,210.), (-10.,195.)] +
`lat="{0.,10.,20.,30.,40.}" lon="{200.,210.,195.}"` - maps centered at latexmath:[(\Theta,\Phi) = (0.,200.) , (10.,210.), (20.,195.), (30.,195.), (40.,195.)]. +

.Note:
The current version of the *fld* can only process individual tracked cubes. +
There is no correction/checking whether the latexmath:[\Phi] that is provided is out of the coverage, and hence the tracked output can be arrays of 'nan's.

==== Look at the series

The tracked cube is stored as fits file inside the DRMS - SUMS directory that can be viewed using the *show_info* command.

[source,shell]
----
show_info kis_vigeesh.hmi_fldvtrack[2010.06.01_00:00:00_TAI/5m] -P key=MidTime,LonHG,LatHG,Duration
----

The essential keywords that will be used by the next modules are: +
*_MidTime, LonHG, LatHG, Duration, Cadence, MapScale, MapProj, Width, Height_*
 
'''

=== 2. Legendre time series - `tld`

==== Create a new data series

A template is available under *kis_vigeesh.hmi_tldcoeff.jsd*. 

----
create_series kis_vigeesh.hmi_tldcoeff.jsd
----

An important thing to note here is that, unlike the other pipeline modules, the data format is set to 'generic' and the output file format is 'hdf5'.
The reasons for this are the following.

.Why generic file format
. The number or _l_, _m_ are not predefined, since we need to have the flexibility in choosing these values at runtime.
. To avoid storing multiple FITS files (latexmath:[A_{lm}, B_{lm}]) under the same data record.
. Writing in parallel is not yet supported for FITS file (AFAIK), which would generate again multiple files for each coefficients depending on the number of processors used under the same data record.
. We can get away with the _meat-grinder_, as we now have access to hyperslabs of data. 


==== Do the *tld*

The input series is the tracked data cube from the *mtrack*. The Mapscale and other quatities are automatically passed on from the input series. The user provides the maximum _l_ and the absolute maximum _m_ that is desired. Presently, the code can only process individual sets of (latexmath:[\Theta,\Phi]) as follows. 

----
mpirun -np 3 tld in=kis_vigeesh.hmi_fldvtrack[2010.06.01_00:00_TAI][+200][0] out=kis_vigeesh.hmi_tldcoeff m_abs=25 l_max=1000
----

.The code runs as follows:
. The master divides the whole data into chunks along the time axis, the number of chunks depend upon the number of processors assigned using the *-np*.
. The master processor opens an hdf5 container file in the local directory and adds in the latexmath:[A_{lm}] and latexmath:[B_{lm}] data spaces to the */lmg* group.
. Each processor then fills in the hdf5 file at the specific location of their respective chunk with transformed complex values of latexmath:[A_{lm}] and latexmath:[B_{lm}].
. Finally the attributes are added to the hdf5 and the file is assigned to the data series where it gets its own SUMS location.



==== Look at the series

----
show_info kis_vigeesh.hmi_tldcoeff[2010.06.01_00:00_TAI] -P key=MidTime,LonHG,LatHG,Duration,lMax,mAbs
----

The file can be viewd using *hdfview* command-line tool.
Apart from the other keywords that are propagated from the *mtrack* module, +
*_MidTime, LonHG, LatHG, Duration, Cadence, MapScale, MapProj, Width, Height_* +
the data series aquires two new keywords as defined below. +

.Aquired Keywords
|====
|Keyword | Datatype | Purpose

|*_lMax_* | int | Maximum _l_ (_l_=0, _l~max~_)
|*_mAbs_* | int | Absolute of the maximum _m_ (_m_= -_m~abs~_, _m~abs~_)
|====

These keywords are then used by the next module without the need for specifying it at runtime.

a = H5D_READ(dataset_Alm)
dataset_Blm = H5D_OPEN(file_id,'/lmg/Blm')
b = H5D_READ(dataset_Blm)
alm = complex(a.real,a.imaginary)
blm = complex(b.real,b.imaginary)

b=f['/lmg/Blm']
alm=a['real']+ 1j * a['imaginary']
blm=b['real'] + 1j * b['imaginary']

plot(alm[0,2,:]['real'])
